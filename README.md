	object[] args0 = new object[]{constants.apiKey,constants.secretKey};
	object[] args2= new object[]{constants.userId};
	object[] args3 = new object[]{constants.callBackMethod,constants.gameObjectName};
	using (AndroidJavaClass cls_obj= new AndroidJavaClass("com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayer")) {
	using (AndroidJavaObject act_Obj = cls_obj.GetStatic<AndroidJavaObject>("currentActivity")) {
	act_Obj.Call("intialize",args0);
	act_Obj.Call("setProjectNo",args1);
